# SportMate

## Introduction
SportMate is an innovative iOS application developed using Swift and SQLite3, designed to connect sports enthusiasts. Our platform facilitates users in finding partners or groups to engage in various sports activities, fostering new connections and promoting a healthy lifestyle.


## Features

## Missing Features
While SportMate boasts several ready-to-deploy features, there are areas earmarked for future development to enhance user experience:

- **Online Database Integration:** Currently, the app uses a local SQLite3 database, which means data storage and retrieval are confined to the user's own device. A crucial upcoming enhancement is the implementation of an online database. This will enable cloud storage of user data, allowing for cross-device accessibility and real-time data synchronization among users.
